    <h2>Visualization Overview</h2>

    <p>For this project, we created the family tree of the Trump family.</p>

    <p>The given data set was changed by creating the new data structure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each <text class="mono">node</text> has 4 attributes:
        <ul>
          <li><text class="mono">name</text>: name of a person or a partnership, i.e., two people's names separated by a dash</li>
          <li><text class="mono">gen</text>: number for a generation (3 identifies a root node, 2 - a child, and so on). Numbers go in a decreasing order</li>
          <li><text class="mono">blood</text>: true identifies that a person is related by a blood line to the Trump's family</li>
          <li><text class="mono">type</text>: person | partnership</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Each <text class="mono">link</text> has 3 attributes:
        <ul>
          <li><text class="mono">source</text>: where a line comes from</li>
          <li><text class="mono">target</text>: where a line goes to</li>
          <li><text class="mono">hidden</text>: true identifies that a link is not visible</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>

    <p class="question"><i>1. Motivate your choices (e.g. choice of color/marks, overall layout etc).</i></p>
	    
    <p>Since we show a representation of the Trump's family tree, we decided to use empty circles for people who are not
	    related to Trump's family by blood line. A small empty black circle with grey lines to people identifies a family.</p>
	    
    <p>Different color for circles were chosen according to a generation. We decided to use a saturation 
	    of red color, i.e., lighter color stands for younger generation. In this way, it is easier to find,
	    for example, a child or grandchild, because chroma is perceived as ordered list unlike hue.
	    Also by using different colors for each generation we would end up with too colorful family tree
	    with no connection between colors.</p>
	    
    <p>In addition to this, some people are color blind so different colors are not helpful for them
	    while separating generations. We tested our red color choice against a color-blind simulator 
	    in <a href="http://www.rehue.net">www.rehue.net<a/>. As it can be seen from <b>Figure 1</b> and <b>Figure 2</b>, 
	    colorful circles cause problems as two different colors, e.g., second image in <b>Figure 2</b>, 
	    are understood as the same color.</p>

    <p>However color saturation is not the best option either, if we have a lot of generations.
	    In this case, it is worth considering having different type of tree like the one in 
	    <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/robschmuecker/7926762">http://bl.ocks.org/robschmuecker/7926762<a/> 
            where you can collapse or expand nodes.</p>

    <p>To make the separation between generations even more obvious we chose different sizes of circle as well.</p>

    <p class="question"><i>2. Suggest how/if the visualization could be improved by adding interactive elements.</i></p>
    <p>When you press on a bubble, i.e., a person, the blood line would be signified and additional information, for example, birthday, image of a person, shown. See an example in <b>Figure 3</b>.</p>
